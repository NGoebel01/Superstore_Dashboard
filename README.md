# Superstore_Dashboard

Follow the link to open the Tableau Dashboard on my profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ng1808/viz/Superstore_16740768784090/DashboardProfits?publish=yes

This dashboard was created using sales data from an office supply superstore. Exploratory analysis was conducted in SQL and data was filtered in SQL when necessary. The dashboard shows sales data over the course of 2014-2017. 

Total profits for each year are stated explicitly in a table at the top of the dashboard. Clicking any year allows the end user to filter the displayed data based on the selected year.

The 'Profits' chart shows sales by month and year with the color indicating the profits for each month. A reference line shows the monthly sales goal of $35,000. Based on this data, we can see that only two months resulted in a loss of profits. 

The 'Biggest Buyers' chart shows which customers bought the most products and how much profit was made from each. Using this data, we might explore what each customer was buying and if they were labeled "consumer", "corporate", etc. to try and sell those items to similar client types.

The 'Best Selling Products' chart shows what items sold the most and what the overall profit was on that item. This can help determine what items may need to be advertised to further increase those sales.

The 'Top/Bottom 5 Most Profitable Items' chart shows which products netted the most profit and which resulted in the biggest losses. This can help determine why products are losing money (such as needing to clear old inventory) and if some products need to stop being offered. Did any of the products that resulted in large losses have any sales where they made a profit?
